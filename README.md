# üß© Sudoku Assistant

## Motivation  
Sudoku is a great way to relax and exercise your brain without the distractions of a smartphone. However, solving complex grids can be time-consuming. Spending an hour trying to place a single digit can be frustrating‚Äîespecially when half the puzzle is already filled in.  

The **Sudoku Assistant** is here to help! It can either solve the entire puzzle for you or suggest the next digit to insert.  
All you need to do is take a clear photo of the puzzle and upload it to the app.
